# Deploying IBM VM in PowerVC using IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management
IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management runs on Red Hat OpenShift that provides consistent visibility governance, and automation from on-premise to the edge. 
With it, you get more application and cluster visibility across the enterprise to public or private cloud. The CP4MCM includes the IBM Cloud Automation Manager 
that automates provisioning of infrastructure and virtual machine applications across multiple cloud environments with optional workflow orchestration. 
We describe how to deploy IBM i virtual machine by using IBM PowerVC that uses Terraform templates.
